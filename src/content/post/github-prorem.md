# Why?

Using any kind of version control system is a Good Thing â„¢

I don't want to go too in depth with all of the technologies involved, so there are some things I will assume that you know already at minimum, or have coworkers that can do this for you:

-   Powershell
-   App registration in Azure AD, this will be used for authentication to Intune from the Github workflow. (needs permission "DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All")
-   JSON, or more specifically: [Working with JSON data in PowerShell](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/working-with-json-data-in-powershell/)

### Testing to see code visualization

#### Articles I read at least parts of while coding

-   TODO: Get list from Edge tabs

#### Documentation references:

-   [Graph API reference for deviceComplianceScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-devices-devicecompliancescript?view=graph-rest-beta)
-   [GitHub Docs - Using workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) - These docs are honestly written horribly confusing, and will certainly send you down the wrong path very often. Good luck.
